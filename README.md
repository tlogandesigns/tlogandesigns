With over 15 years of experience in marketing, advertising, and real estate, I’m passionate about blending technology with human connection to drive results.

My journey has been defined by helping small businesses harness the power of AI. Through my platform, AI for Professionals, I create resources, courses, and tools that empower entrepreneurs to streamline operations and enhance productivity. My book on AI for small businesses and my role in developing custom GPT tools exemplify my dedication to making advanced technology accessible and practical for non-tech audiences.

In the real estate world, I’ve led efforts to optimize operations, from marketing strategies to compliance monitoring. My work as a licensed Realtor and compliance officer allows me to ensure that ads and communications meet industry standards while fostering meaningful connections with clients and colleagues.
